This preference is often influenced by factors such as mobility, convenience, and accessibility, as older individuals may find driving offers more comfort and flexibility.\n   - **Younger Residents**: While they also use cars, younger individuals might rely on them less frequently, often opting for alternative modes of transport like cycling or ridesharing services. Their car usage may be driven by lifestyle choices or financial considerations.\n\n2. **Public Transport Use:**\n   - **Older Residents**: May show lower levels of public transport use compared to younger people, possibly due to limited availability of services that meet their needs or preferences for direct and comfortable travel options.\n   - **Younger Residents**: Generally have higher public transport usage rates. They are often more open to using buses, trains, and trams, which align with their lifestyles, especially if they are in urban areas where public transport is accessible and affordable.\n\nIn summary, older residents in Skåne tend to prefer car use for travel, while younger residents are more inclined to utilize public transport, reflecting differences in mobility preferences and lifestyle factors.",
