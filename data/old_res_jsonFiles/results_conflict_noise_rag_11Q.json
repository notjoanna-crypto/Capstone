    "expected_answer": "Older residents travel significantly more by car, while younger residents use public transport to a greater extent.",
    "generated_answer": "Based on typical findings from surveys like the Skåne travel survey, travel behavior often shows notable differences between older and younger residents:\n\n1. **Car Use:**\n   - **Older Residents:** Generally, older individuals tend to rely more on cars for their daily transport needs. This is often due to factors like the convenience and comfort associated with driving, as well as potential mobility challenges that might limit their use of other transport modes.\n   - **Younger Residents:** In contrast, younger people might use cars less frequently, particularly in urban areas. They may prefer alternative modes of transport, such as cycling or walking, or they may rely on shared mobility options like ride-sharing.\n\n2. **Public Transport Use:**\n   - **Older Residents:** While older adults may use public transport, their usage can be influenced by accessibility and convenience. Some may not feel comfortable with public transit due to physical mobility issues or a lack of services in their area.\n   - **Younger Residents:** Younger residents typically have higher rates of public transport usage. They are often more open to using buses, trains, and trams, particularly in urban environments where these options are more available and convenient.\n\nIn summary, younger residents in Skåne are more inclined to use public transport and alternative modes of travel, while older residents tend to favor car use due to convenience and comfort, influencing overall mobility patterns in the region.",
